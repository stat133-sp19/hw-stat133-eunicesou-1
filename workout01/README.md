This workout assingment is about visualizing the shot data of five Golden State Warrior Players. More specifically, it will be producing so-called “shot charts” for these players, as well as other summaries and visualizations of the shots attempted and made throughout the 2016 season. Using all the data gatherd for the players, we then comapre their effective shooting percentages by first looking at their 2PT Field Goal, followed by their 3PT Field Goal, and finally their overall effective shooting percentages.
