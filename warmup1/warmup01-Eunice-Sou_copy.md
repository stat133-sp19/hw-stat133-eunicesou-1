Cooking Recipe

Cozy Cabbage and Farro Soup

Ingredients:

-   1 pound cabbage, svaoy or green
-   Olive oil
-   1 medium onion, thinly sliced
-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
-   3 garlic cloves, smashed and peeled
-   1 sprig of rosemary or thyme
-   1 tablespoon red wine or white wine vinegar
-   2/3 cup uncooked farro
-   About 4 cups homemade or storebought chicken or vegetable broth
-   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
-   Shaved parmesan, to finish

Special Kitchen Tools Needed:

-   Dutch Oven

Recipe:

1.  Cut out the cabbage core and finely chop it.
2.  Cut the leaves into fine shreds or about 1/8-inch ribbons.
3.  Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium heat.
4.  Add the onion and cabbage core, some salt and pepper, and cook, stirring frequently, until the onion starts to soften but is not yet browned, about 5 to 7 minutes.
5.  Add the garlic and cook another 3 to 5 minutes, until the garlic softens too. Add the shredded cabbage leaves and herb sprig, if using.
6.  Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pot and let it steam a bit to soften the leaves, then toss the cabbage to combine with other ingredients.
7.  Cook, covered, until the cabbage is very sweet and tender, which the book says will take 30 minutes but I find 15 to 20 minutes usually does the trick.
8.  Stir occasionally.
9.  Meanwhile, in a small skillet, heat a glug of olive oil over medium and add the uncooked farro.
10. Toast it, stirring, for a few minutes, until half a shade darker.
11. When the cabbage is ready, stir in the vinegar.
12. Taste and season with more salt and pepper.
13. Add toasted farro and broth.
14. Bring mixture to a lazy simmer and cook for 25 to 35 minutes, until farro is tender and all the flavors are married.
15. The soup will be very thick, but if you’d prefer more liquid, add another 1/2 cup broth or water.
16. Taste and adjust seasoning again.
17. Stir in lemon juice.
18. Ladle into bowls and finish each with a drizzle of olive oil and a shower of parmesan, with more parmesan passed at the table.

Special Season of the year for the soup:

Winter Time.

Variations of the recipe:

Savoy cabbage tends to brown and seem fully cooked far sooner than the recipe suggests it will be (30 minutes). With a regular green cabbage, it might need the full softening time.

Keep adding salt and pepper until it tastes right.

Euclidean Distance

Definition
----------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*1, *q*2, ..., *q**n*) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from q to p is given by the Pythagorean formula:

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the pace (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The Euclidean norm, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

where the last expression involves the dot product.
